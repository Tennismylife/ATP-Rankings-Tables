# ATP-Rankings-Tables
This work starts from ATP tables available in the ATP website and many sources just like Wikipedia. For filling the gap from 1973 to 1984 I used the Slasher1985 tables foundble on web. From 1985 to 1989 I've used the tennis players ATP breakdown tables. Taking the gained ATP Points we can calculate the ATP points given by a specific tournament. This calculation includes the bonus points distillation too. Same method was used for 1990-1999 period, but here we can make a match-up between gained points by tennis players and the tournament prize money: 2 ways to calculate the ATP points giving the same result. From 2000-current I used tables from web and Wikipedia also calculable with the explained method. Thanks to Slasher1985's work is possible to extend the ATP rankings to 1968-1972 period basing to 1973 used method.
